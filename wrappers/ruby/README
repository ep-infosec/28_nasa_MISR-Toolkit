This directory contains wrappers to allow the MISR Toolkit to be used in Ruby.

The software is documented, see "doc/index.html" for a detailed description 
of the library.

To Install this package:

1. You need to have NArray installed (can be acquired at
   http://www.ir.isas.jaxa.jp/~masa/ruby/index-e.html).

2. Also, the MISR toolkit and supporting library needs to be built and
   installed.

3. Set the environment variable MTKHOME to the base of the MISR Toolkit
   installation.

4. If you haven't done so already, source the hdfeos_env.sh found in the
   HDF-EOS library installation. This will set the environment variables
   HDFEOS_INC, HDFEOS_LIB, HDFINC, HDFLIB.

5. Install RubyGems if it isn't already on your system (see 
   http://docs.rubygems.org).

6. If you wish to run the units tests while installing the gem (i.e.,
   use the -t option), you need to do a separate download of the MISR
   toolkit test data - the test data is not included in the MISR
   toolkit download. You then need to set the environment variable
   MTKTESTHOME to the directory with the test data before running the
   unit tests.

   This step can be skipped if you don't want to run the unit tests.

7. From this directory, type "gem install MisrToolkit". This needs to be run
   as root, either login as root or run "sudo gem install MisrToolkit".

8. Documentation is available as for any Ruby gem - point to 
   http://localhost:8808 if you are running gem_server, or just point 
   directly to the doc directory for the gem (do "gem environment gemdir", 
   if you don't know where the gems are installed on your system).
