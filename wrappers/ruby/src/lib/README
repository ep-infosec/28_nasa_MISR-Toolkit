This contains Ruby wrappers around the MISR toolkit. This provides easy access
to the MISR Level 1 and Level 2 files.

The top level class is MtkFile.

We also provide generic wrapper for HDF-EOS. These wrappers can be used to
read the MISR Level 3 data, or HDF-EOS files from other EOS instruments 
(e.g., MODIS, ASTER). The top level class for the generic wrappers is HdfFile.
